It has a dynamic schema, best suited for hierarchical data storage. It is horizontally scalable.\n","\n","Whereas **SQL databases** are used for querying and manipulating structured query language (SQL) and are very powerful and versatile, they also have the disadvantage of being restrictive: SQL requires the usage of predefined schemas to determine the structure of the data before you work with it; Also all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant prior preparation, which offers challenges.\n","\n","A **NoSQL database** has dynamic schema for unstructured data. It stores data in many ways, such as document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a prior defined structure. Also, each document can have its own unique structure. The syntax varies from database to database, and you can add fields as you go.\n","\n","Here are some key comparisons between SQL and NoSQL\n","\n","- **Scalability**: SQL databases are vertically scalable. This allows an increase in load on a single server by increasing the RAM, CPU, or SSD; NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable i.e. it can handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database\n","- **Structure**: SQL databases are table-based. NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases, or wide-column stores. Relational SQL databases are a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system.\n","- **Property**: SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL databases follow the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance). \n","- **Examples**: Examples of SQL databases include PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. NoSQL database examples include Cassandra, MongoDB, BigTable, HBase, Neo4j and CouchDB."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oTDlxz-LYANr"},"source":["**Why we need NoSQL databases?**\n","\n","We see two primary reasons why people consider using a NoSQL database.\n","* Productivity in Application development: A lot of application development effort is spent on mapping data between in-memory data structures and a relational database. A NoSQL database may provide a data model that better fits the application’s needs, thus simplifying that interaction and resulting in less code to write, debug, and evolve.\n","* Large-scale data: Organizations are finding it valuable to capture more data and process it more quickly. They are finding it expensive, if even possible, to do so with relational databases. The primary reason is that a relational database is designed to run on a single machine, but it is usually more economic to run large data and computing loads on clusters of many smaller and cheaper machines. Many NoSQL databases are designed explicitly to run on clusters, so they make a better fit for big data scenarios.\n","\n","**Terminology**\n","\n","The basic terms related to NoSQL databases are as follows:\n","\n","* **Big data:** a collection of data that is huge in volume, yet growing exponentially with time.\n","* **Polyglot persistent:** a term that refers to using different data stores in different circumstances.\n","* **Database cluster:** a collection of databases that is managed by a single instance of a running database server.

This is the equivalent of an RDBMS table.\n","\n","* **Graph stores** are used to store information about networks of data, for instance, social connections. Graph stores include Neo4J and Giraph.\n","\n","* **Key-value stores** databases store every single item in the database as a key together with its value. Examples of key-value stores are Riak and Berkeley DB. Some key-value stores, such as Redis, allow each value to have a type, such as an integer, which adds functionality.\n","\n","* **Wide-column** stores such as Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large datasets, and store columns of data together, instead of rows.\n","\n","<figure>\n","<img src='https://cdn.iisc.talentsprint.com/CDS/Images/Nosql_databases.png' />\n","</figure>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BNLA8HiKxQhc"},"source":["### Setup Steps:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dxCv5teXYANs"},"source":["### Importing required packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":23,"status":"ok","timestamp":1641670169481,"user":{"displayName":"shambhavi seth","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh20oin3w2PRiKUhrvgT0XoIOjlTZOhPgvWiKgfFNg=s64","userId":"04318899503633324567"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"ZB8vMNkUYANt"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from pprint import pprint"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tZIn8pabYANt"},"source":["### Loading the data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":23,"status":"ok","timestamp":1641670169483,"user":{"displayName":"shambhavi seth","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh20oin3w2PRiKUhrvgT0XoIOjlTZOhPgvWiKgfFNg=s64","userId":"04318899503633324567"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"aFILodbNYANu"},"outputs":[],"source":["students = pd.read_csv('students.csv')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YSlOKrW6YANu"},"source":["### Cassandra"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jlBCo3h3YANu"},"source":["Apache Cassandra is a free, open-source, distributed, wide-column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
